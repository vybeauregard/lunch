## Lunch
#### A Laravel project

_Lunch_ was started as a way to familiarize myself with Laravel, based on a previous project written in another framework.

The app serves as both a method to determine where to eat lunch today at nearby restaurants, as well as a log to keep track of resturants patronized within recent history.

There is an interface for creating new resturants along with relevant cuisine attributes, and a random "i-can't-decide-where-to-eat-just-tell-me-where-I'm-going" restaurant picker.

The app touches on a lot of Laravel fundamentals, such as database migrations, Model relationships, and basic resource controllers.
